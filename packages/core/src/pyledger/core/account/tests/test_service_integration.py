"""Integration tests for AccountService against real MongoDB infrastructure.

These tests do NOT re-verify validation branches, DTO field mapping, or
repository-internal behavior — that is already covered by
``test_service.py`` (fake-repo unit tests) and
``infrastructure/mongo/account/tests/test_repository_integration.py``
(Mongo adapter tests).

The only thing these tests exist to prove is that
``AccountService`` produces the same business-correct outcome when wired
to ``MongoAccountRepo`` instead of ``FakeAccountRepo`` — i.e. that the
DTO -> domain -> Mongo -> domain -> view-model seam holds end to end, and
that the service's pre-check and MongoDB's unique index agree on what
counts as a duplicate.
