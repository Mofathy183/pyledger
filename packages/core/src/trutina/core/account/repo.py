"""Repository contract for the account feature.

Defines the persistence boundary used by AccountService. All account
storage operations pass through this contract, regardless of the
underlying storage technology.

Implementations must remain asynchronous, must not contain business
rules, and must translate storage-specific failures into AppError
instances before they cross this boundary.

Exception Contract
------------------

Concrete implementations must translate storage-specific failures into
AppError before they cross the repository boundary.

Services depend only on AppError and must never be coupled to storage
libraries, database drivers, or transport-specific exceptions.

The exact translation strategy is implementation-specific.
