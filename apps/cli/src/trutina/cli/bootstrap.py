"""Construction boundary for ``CliContext``.

``build_context()`` is the only function defined here. It resolves which
``Settings`` instance to use and constructs a ``CliContext`` from it.

Constructing a ``CliContext`` performs no I/O of its own -- no MongoDB
connection, no Beanie initialization -- regardless of what gets imported
to define the types involved. Importing this module transitively imports
``trutina.cli.context``, which in turn imports the concrete MongoDB
repository and document classes it may later construct; those imports
happen at module load time and are not I/O. The actual network
connection is only opened the first time a command calls one of
``CliContext``'s ``get_*_repo()``/``get_*_service()`` accessors -- see
``context.py`` for that boundary.

Callers decide which ``Settings`` subclass to use and pass it in
explicitly. In production, ``main.py`` calls ``build_context()`` with no
argument, so the returned ``CliContext`` falls back to the cached
``get_settings()`` accessor. Test fixtures call it (or construct
``CliContext`` directly) with an explicit ``TestSettings`` instance. This
module never decides between ``Settings`` and ``TestSettings`` itself.

    Performs no I/O. The entire body is construction only -- opening a

    services are all deferred to ``CliContext``'s own lazy accessors and
    happen only on first use, never here.
