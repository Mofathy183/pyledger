"""Router for the system feature: root and health endpoints.

Structural exception to the standard API workflow (Router → Handler →
Mapper/Service → Presenter). That pipeline exists to translate between
HTTP request/response shapes and domain DTOs — these two endpoints do
neither: there's no request body, no domain model, no AppError to
translate. Keeping this flat avoids three files that would each just
pass a value through unchanged. Promote to the full pattern only if an
endpoint here starts doing real work (e.g. aggregating dependency
health checks).

No prefix on this router by design — "/" and "/health" are root-level
paths, not namespaced under "/system". Don't copy this file's lack of
a prefix as a template for a real feature router.
