"""Public HTTP request/response contracts for the account feature.

These schemas are the API's own presentation-layer types. They are
structurally similar to `modules/account/dtos.py`'s DTOs and
`AccountViewModel`/`ChartOfAccountsViewModel` by design -- the account
resource has one natural shape -- but are kept as separate classes so
the public HTTP contract can evolve independently of the service
boundary's DTOs, exactly as `PyLedger API Feature & Testing Prompt`
Section 2 requires ("Response Schema... Must never expose internal
domain/DTO field names it hasn't deliberately chosen to mirror").

Request schemas perform FastAPI/Pydantic structural validation only.
Business rules (uniqueness, name-format validation) fire later, inside
AccountService and the Account domain model, and are translated to the
standard error envelope by `api/shared/errors/handlers.py`.

    submit; both are optional so a caller may update just one.
    Omitted vs. explicitly `null` follows the same DTO-level semantics
    as `UpdateAccountInput` (see `modules/account/dtos.py`): both mean
    "leave the existing value in place," since the mapper always
    forwards the field, and `AccountService.update_account()` treats a
    `None` value as "unchanged" rather than "clear the field" -- there
    is no way to null out `name` or `category` through this endpoint,
    consistent with the domain model requiring both to always be set.
