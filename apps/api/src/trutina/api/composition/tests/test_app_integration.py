        lifespan; there is no app.include_router() call anywhere in
        source), so this hits FastAPI's own built-in OpenAPI docs route
        rather than an application route, purely to prove the ASGI app
        is servable end to end. Once a real route exists (Phase 3),
        prefer hitting that instead.
