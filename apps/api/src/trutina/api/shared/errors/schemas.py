"""Response envelope schemas for the Trutina API.

BaseResponse defines the two fields every JSON body carries regardless
of outcome -- `success` and `timestamp` -- so the success envelopes each
feature's presenter.py builds from a ViewModel (e.g.
AccountResponse(BaseResponse)) and the error envelopes this module's
exception handlers build share one consistent top-level shape. This
module owns only the error side: ErrorResponse and
ValidationErrorResponse.

ValidationErrorResponse extends ErrorResponse rather than `details`
living on the base -- a plain not-found or conflict has nothing
field-level to report, so it never carries a `details` array at all,
instead of carrying one that's always None.
