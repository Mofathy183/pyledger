"""Shared response envelope primitives for the Trutina API.

BaseResponse defines the two fields every JSON body carries regardless
of outcome. SuccessResponse and the error envelopes in
`api/shared/errors/schemas.py` both build on top of it, so a client can
always branch on `success` without inferring outcome from the HTTP
status code alone.
