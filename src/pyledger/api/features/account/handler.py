"""Input DTO -> AccountService call -> ViewModel for the account feature.

Each handler is exactly one service call, per
`PyLedger API Feature & Testing Prompt` Section 2/3: no FastAPI import,
no Mapper/Presenter construction, no exception handling. Any
``AppError``/``ValidationAppError``/``pydantic.ValidationError`` raised
by ``AccountService`` propagates uncaught -- ``api/shared/errors/handlers.py``
is the single translation seam for all of it, exactly as it already is
for a mapper-stage domain-construction failure.

Every function here is a plain ``async def`` callable identically from
a router or directly from a unit test against a ``Fake*Repo``-backed
``AccountService`` -- mirroring the CLI's own ``handler.py`` contract.
