"""
User-facing resolution hints for validation errors.

This module provides actionable guidance that helps users correct
validation failures. Hints are intentionally kept separate from error
messages so that message copy and resolution guidance can be updated
independently.

Like the error map, hints are keyed by error type rather than field
name. This ensures hints remain valid as the domain model evolves and
dynamic field paths such as ``lines.0.account`` are handled without
any changes to this file.

Every member of ``ErrorCode`` must have an entry here -- this is
verified by ``cli/constants/tests/test_errors.py``.

type HintMap = dict[str, str]
"""
Maps a validation error type to a plain-text resolution hint.

Keys match the error type strings in ``ERRORS`` from. Values are plain text with no
Rich markup. Markup is applied by the formatter at display time.
